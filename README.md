# Model-Development

Comparison of three models (Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Fit) to find the best model that is able to predict the price of a car using highway mpg as a predictor variable, based on data obtained from 'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DA0101EN/automobileEDA.csv'. 

The best fit is presented by the Polynomial Fit since it has a lower MSE and a higher R-squared value
